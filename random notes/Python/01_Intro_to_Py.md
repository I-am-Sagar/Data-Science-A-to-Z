## 01 - Introduction to Python

### 1.1 - What are programming languages?

Programming languages are used to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions, also known as code, are written in a specific syntax, or language, that the computer can interpret and carry out.

Think of programming languages like different languages spoken by humans. Just as people use different languages to communicate with one another, programmers use different programming languages to communicate with computers.

There are many different programming languages, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular programming languages include:

* Python - known for its readability and ease of use
* Java - used for building enterprise-level applications and websites
* C++ - used for building high-performance applications and video games
* JavaScript - used for building interactive web applications

To give you an analogy, think of a programming language like a musical instrument. Just as different instruments have different sounds and capabilities, different programming languages have different strengths and are better suited for different types of tasks.

For example, just as a guitar might be best suited for playing rock music and a violin might be better suited for classical music, Python might be best suited for data analysis and scientific computing, while Java might be better suited for building large-scale enterprise applications.

### 1.2 - How computers understand the programming language?

Computers don't understand programming languages in the same way that humans do. When a programmer writes code in a programming language, they use special words and symbols that are specific to that language. These words and symbols make up a set of instructions that tell the computer what to do.

To help the computer understand these instructions, the code must first be translated into a form that the computer can read. This process is called "compiling" or "interpreting".

Imagine you have a recipe written in a language you don't understand. You could ask someone to translate it for you, and then follow their instructions to create the dish. In a similar way, a computer uses a compiler or interpreter to translate the code written in a programming language into machine code that it can execute.

When a programmer writes Python code, it is written in plain text using a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE). In our classes, we have majorly used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for this. This code is then saved in a file with a ".py" extension, which tells the computer that the file contains Python code.

To run a Python code, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Python:** First, you need to install Python on your computer. Python is a free and open-source programming language, and you can download it from the official website at python.org. Choose the version of Python that is compatible with your operating system.
2. **Write your code:** Once you have installed Python, you can write your code in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE). You can save the code in a file with a ".py" extension.
3. **Open the command prompt or terminal:** To run your Python code, you need to open the command prompt or terminal on your computer. This is a program that allows you to enter commands directly to the computer.
4. **Navigate to the directory where your code is saved:** In the command prompt or terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate to the directory where your Python code is saved. For example, if your code is saved in a folder called "my_code" on your desktop, you can type "cd desktop/my_code" to navigate to that folder.
5. **Run your code:** Once you are in the correct directory, you can run your Python code by typing "python filename.py" in the command prompt or terminal, where "filename.py" is the name of your Python code file. Press enter, and your Python code will run, and the output will be displayed in the terminal.

When the Python program is run, the computer reads the Python code from the file and interprets it into machine code that it can execute. This interpretation process is done by the Python interpreter, which is a program that understands the Python language and knows how to translate it into machine code.

The Python interpreter reads the Python code line by line, and performs the instructions written in the code. For example, if the code instructs the computer to print a message on the screen, the interpreter will execute this instruction by sending the message to the computer's screen.

### 1.3 - Why should I learn Python?

Python is a popular programming language that is used for a wide range of applications. Here are some reasons why you should learn Python:

* **Easy to learn:** Python is designed to be easy to learn and use, even for beginners. It has a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to read and understand, which means you can start writing code quickly.
* **Versatile:** Python is a versatile language that can be used for many different applications. It can be used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, game development, and more.
* **Large community:** Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to open-source libraries and frameworks, making it easier to find help, learn from others, and build projects faster.
* **High demand:** Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it is in high demand among employers. Learning Python can make you more marketable and give you a competitive edge in the job market.
* **Productivity:** Python's simplicity and ease of use can help you be more productive and write code faster. It has a wide range of libraries and tools that can help you automate repetitive tasks and build complex applications quickly.
* **Fun and creative:** Python is a fun and creative language that allows you to build interesting projects, from web apps to games to robots. With Python, you can unleash your creativity and build things that you never thought were possible.

In summary, learning Python can be a great investment in your future, as it is a versatile, easy-to-learn, and highly in-demand language. Whether you want to build web applications, analyze data, or explore artificial intelligence, Python is a great language to start with.

### 1.4 - The Interactive Prompt/REPL

The Interactive Prompt, also known as the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), is a feature in many programming languages that allows you to interact with the language in real-time. It provides a command-line interface where you can enter commands and see the output immediately.

Think of the Interactive Prompt as a conversation between you and the programming language. You can ask it questions and give it commands, and it will respond with answers and results.

For example, let's say you are learning Python, and you want to try out some basic arithmetic operations. You can open up the Python REPL by typing "python" in your terminal and hitting `Enter` key, and you will see the prompt ">>>".

Now, you can enter some basic arithmetic commands, such as:

```py
>>> 2 + 3
5
>>> 5 * 4
20
>>> 10 / 2
5.0
```

As you can see, the REPL immediately responds with the output of each command. This allows you to experiment with the language and try out different commands and operations in real-time.

The Interactive Prompt is also useful for debugging and testing code. You can enter small snippets of code and see the results immediately, without having to write a full program.

In summary, the Interactive Prompt or REPL is a feature in many programming languages that allows you to interact with the language in real-time. It provides a command-line interface where you can enter commands and see the output immediately. It's a useful tool for experimenting with the language, testing code, and debugging.
