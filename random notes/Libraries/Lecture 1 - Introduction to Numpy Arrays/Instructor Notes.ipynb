    "Explain students that the soul of numpy is - numpy arrays. 1D Arrays are just a linear collection of items of same type. You can nest them to make 2D and 3D arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Example of 1D array: You have a list of temperatures recorded each day for a week: [25, 26, 24, 28, 27, 25, 23]. \n",
    "- Example of 2D array: You can think of them as having rows and columns, just like a spreadsheet. For instance, consider a list of students and their corresponding marks in three subjects: Math, English, and Science. You can represent this data in a 2D array, where each row represents a student and each column represents a subject.\n",
    "- Example of 3D array: They can be visualized as a stack of 2D arrays. For example, imagine you have a collection of grayscale images, where each image is a 2D array representing pixel intensities. If you want to store multiple images, you can use a 3D array. \n",

    "1. **np.zeros()**: This function creates an array filled with zeros. </br> Example: Suppose you want to create an array of size 5, representing the number of seats available in a row in a movie theater. You can use np.zeros() to create the array with all seats initially set to zero. </br></br>\n",
    "2. **np.ones():** This function creates an array filled with ones.</br> Example: Let's say you want to create an array to represent the number of goals scored by a football team in five matches. You can use np.ones() to create the array with all elements initially set to one.</br></br>\n",
    "3. **np.arange():** This function creates an array with a sequence of numbers. </br> Example: Imagine you need an array containing numbers from 0 to 9. You can utilize np.arange() to create the array with the desired sequence.</br></br>\n",
    "4. **np.linspace():** This function creates an array with evenly spaced values between a specified range. </br>Example: Suppose you want to create an array of 6 values ranging from 0 to 1, representing intervals of time. You can use np.linspace() to achieve this.</br></br>\n",
    "5. **np.full():** This function creates an array with all elements set to a specific value. </br> Example: Let's say you want to create an array representing the brightness levels of pixels in a grayscale image, where all pixels have an initial brightness value of 128. You can utilize np.full() to create the array with the desired value.</br></br>\n",
    "6. **np.empty():** This function creates an array without initializing its elements to any particular value. The values in the array can be arbitrary and vary each time the function is called. </br> Example: Suppose you need an array of size 4, representing the scores of participants in a competition. You can use np.empty() to create the array without initializing the values.\n",
