You store this data in a 2D NumPy array, where each row represents a specific product, and each column represents the sales for a particular day. Now, let's say you want to analyze the sales by days rather than by products. In other words, you want to transform the array so that each row represents a specific day, and each column represents the sales of different products on that day. The `transpose` function or `.T` attribute rearranges the dimensions of the array, effectively swapping the rows with columns. In this case, it converts the original (3, 5) array into a transposed (5, 3) array. Now, each row represents a specific day, and each column represents the sales of different products on that day. This transformed array allows you to easily analyze and compare the sales across different days for each product.\n",
