### Idea

There is this idea of merging data in Excel, SQL and Pandas. We have data in two tables/spreadsheets that have one column in common, and based on that common column we merge the data of those two tables. In Excel, it is called _lookups_; in SQL, it is called _joins_ and in Pandas, it is called _merging_. 

So, can't we teach them this concept once and three different implementations? It is more relatable and skills are transferable. If I am able to do one thing in Excel, I should be able to do the same thing in SQL as well. 

Let's look at the challenges we would face if this is done.
